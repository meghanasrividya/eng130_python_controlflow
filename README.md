# Python Control Flow
- Control flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated.
## if ,elif ,else
 - An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
 - The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
 - The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
### loops-for loop -while loop
#### for loop
 - A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
 - This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
#### while loop
- With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
### Python keywords break -continue etc.
#### break:
- With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true.
#### continue:
- With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next
